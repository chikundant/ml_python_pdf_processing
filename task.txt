Objective
Build a simple AI-powered system that can accept text and/or PDF files, extract their content, and use this as a knowledge base to answer user questions.

Functional Requirements
Upload text and/or PDF files via API or a basic web interface.
Extract and store the content from uploaded files.
Build a lightweight knowledge base using the extracted content.
Provide an API and simple web interface for:
- Listing all uploaded documents.
- Asking a question and receiving an answer based on the stored knowledge.
- Deleting uploaded documents.

Technical Details
Use any self-implemented ML/NLP logic, such as:
Simple keyword search / string similarity
Basic TF-IDF vectorization + cosine similarity
Or any other classic ML/NLP approach of your choice
It is not allowed to use external paid or proprietary AI APIs (such as OpenAI, Gemini, Azure AI, Hugging Face Inference API, etc.).
Store document texts and metadata in a local database.

Recommended API Endpoints
POST /api/files/ — upload a file
GET /api/files/ — list uploaded files
DELETE /api/files/<id>/ — delete a file
POST /api/ask/ — ask a question ({"question": "your question"}), return an answer

Bonus (Not Required, but Appreciated)
Docker support
Unit tests for API and ML components
Asynchronous file processing
A simple, clean web interface (can be built using HTML templates or any frontend framework)

Deliverables
Source code (GitHub link or archive)
A README file with clear instructions for setting up and using the project
A brief description of the chosen ML/NLP approach and implementation details

Notes
The AI does not have to be perfect — a simple working implementation is sufficient. Creativity, clean code, and well-structured project organization are highly valued.
